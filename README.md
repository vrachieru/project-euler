This is a collection of solutions to the problems proposed by Project Euler. 

The solutions consist of a variety of approaches and programming languages in the idea of developing language specific skills as well as algorithmic thinking.

__Note:__ If you haven't solved the problems yourself, I would advise
you to at least try to solve them before looking at the solutions.

> _"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)_
